# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We are planning to create a game that involves a maze. We are going to use unity to create a maze that has multiple inputs using "if" statements. The user will need to input the correct answers to "if" states in order to correctly navigate the maze.

We are considering adding in an "enemy" to track the user during their time in the maze. We are unsure if this is going to be feasible with the skills we have related to programming.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am collaborating with Sam and Ryan on this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How long should we aim for the game to last?
